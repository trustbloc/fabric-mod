v2.0.0-alpha Release Notes - April 9, 2019
------------------------------------------

What's New in Hyperledger Fabric v2.0
-------------------------------------

The following major features are included in the v2.0.0 Alpha release:

FAB-11237 - Improved chaincode lifecycle
The Fabric 2.0 Alpha introduces decentralized governance for chaincode, with a
new process for installing a chaincode on your peers and starting it on a
channel. The new Fabric chaincode lifecycle allows multiple organizations to
come to agreement on the parameters of a chaincode, such as the chaincode
endorsement policy, before it can be used to interact with the ledger.

FAB-11144 - Native token support
The Fabric 2.0 Alpha provides users the ability to easily represent assets
as tokens on Fabric channels. FabToken is a token management system that uses
an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model to issue, transfer, and redeem tokens
using the identity and membership infrastructure provided by Hyperledger Fabric.
A new 'token' command line interface is included as a way to drive token transactions
without an application.

FAB-6135 - Raft Consensus
Introduced in v1.4.1 and v2.0.0 Alpha, the ordering service now provides
an option to use the Raft Consensus algorithm. Raft is a crash fault tolerant
(CFT) ordering service based on an implementation of Raft protocol in etcd.

FAB-11096 - Docker images with Alpine Linux
Hyperledger Fabric Docker images will now use Alpine Linux,
a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution.

New operational metrics and health checks
FAB-13088 Endorser metrics
FAB-14077 Orderer communication metrics
FAB-11937 Raft metrics
FAB-13237 Metrics for log records
FAB-12727 Gossip metrics
FAB-13341 Kafka health check
FAB-12908 CouchDB health check

Changes, Known Issues, and Workarounds
--------------------------------------

FAB-11237 - Improved chaincode lifecycle
The new Fabric chaincode lifecycle in the v2.0.0 Alpha release is not yet feature
complete. Specifically, be aware of the following limitations in the Alpha release:
- CouchDB indexes are not yet supported
- Chaincodes defined with the new lifecycle are not yet discoverable via service discovery
These limitations will be resolved after the Alpha release.


FAB-11096 - Docker images with Alpine Linux
Bash is no longer available in Fabric images. Utilize Alpine's built-in
sh or ash instead.

FAB-12075 - Duplicate Go Client identity library removed
If vendoring the Client identity library (CID) in chaincode, import
github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim/ext/cid
rather than
github.com/hyperledger/fabriccore/chaincode/lib/cid/cid.go

FAB-12088 - Java chaincode support on s390x architecture
Java chaincode support is not yet available on s390x architecture.

FAB-12134 Same chaincode source receiving fingerprint mismatch error
Chaincode installed in different ways may result in "chaincode fingerprint
mismatch data mismatch" error upon instantiation.  This may happen when
installing chaincode by using different SDKs. To workaround the problem,
package the chaincode prior to installation and instantiation, by using
the "peer chaincode package" command.

Known Vulnerabilities
---------------------
FAB-8664 - Peer should detect and react when its org has been removed
This is a relatively low severity problem, because it requires a significant
conspiracy of network admins, but it will be addressed in a future release.

Resolved Vulnerabilities
------------------------
None.

Other improvements and fixes
----------------------------
FAB-13471 - Fix for multiple chaincode upgrades in a single block
FAB-14687 - Fix memory leak in gossip message store
Updated to Go version 1.11.5
Updated baseimage version to 0.4.15 for third party dependencies.
