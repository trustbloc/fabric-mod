Have Questions?
===============

We try to maintain a comprehensive set of documentation for various
audiences. However, we realize that often there are questions that
remain unanswered. For any technical questions relating to TrustBloc
not answered here, please use

`Gitter <https://gitter.im/trustbloc/community?source=orgpage>`__  (an alternative to Slack) on the #trustbloc-questions channel.

.. note:: Please, when asking about problems you are facing tell us
          about the environment in which you are experiencing those
          problems including the OS, which version of Docker you are
          using, etc.
