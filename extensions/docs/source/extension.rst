Hyperledger Fabric Extensions
=============================

Hyperledger Fabric Extensions are a set of enhancements to Hyperledger Fabric.
The aim of these enhancements are to allow for **performance enhancements** (such as Block Storage,
gossip etc) and **feature enhancements** (such as DCAS - *Distributed Content Addressable
Storage*) for private data collections, in-memory data cache stores instead of
leveldb or fs stores, peer roles separations (committer vs endorser), etc.

Hyperledger Fabric Extensions are integrated into Hyperledger Fabric through
hooks. The following extensions packages are currently available:


   - **Block Storage**
   - **Collections**
   - **Gossip**
   - **ID store**
   - **Private Data Storage**
   - **Roles**
   - **Service**
   - **Transient Store**
