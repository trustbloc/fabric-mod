Chaincode for Developers
========================

What is Chaincode?
------------------

Chaincode is a program, written in `Go <https://golang.org>`_, `node.js <https://nodejs.org>`_,
or `Java <https://java.com/en/>`_ that implements a prescribed interface.
Chaincode runs in a secured Docker container isolated from the endorsing peer
process. Chaincode initializes and manages the ledger state through transactions
submitted by applications.

A chaincode typically handles business logic agreed to by members of the
network, so it similar to a "smart contract". A chaincode can be invoked to update or query
the ledger in a proposal transaction. Given the appropriate permission, a chaincode
may invoke another chaincode, either in the same channel or in different channels, to access its state.
Note that, if the called chaincode is on a different channel from the calling chaincode,
only read query is allowed. That is, the called chaincode on a different channel is only a ``Query``,
which does not participate in state validation checks in subsequent commit phase.

In the following sections, we will explore chaincode through the eyes of an
application developer. We'll present a simple chaincode sample application
and walk through the purpose of each method in the Chaincode Shim API.

Chaincode API
-------------

Every chaincode program must implement the ``Chaincode`` interface whose methods
are called in response to received transactions. You can find the reference
documentation of the Chaincode Shim API for different languages below:

  - `Go <https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim#Chaincode>`__
  - `node.js <https://fabric-shim.github.io/ChaincodeInterface.html>`__
  - `Java <https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-chaincode-java/master/api/org/hyperledger/fabric/shim/Chaincode.html>`_

In each language, the ``Invoke`` method is called by clients to submit transaction
proposals. This method allows you to use the chaincode to read and write data on
the channel ledger.

You also need to include an ``Init`` method that will serve as the initialization
function for your chaincode. This method will be called in order to initialize
the chaincode when it is started or upgraded. By default, this function is never
executed. However, you can use the chaincode definition to request that the ``Init``
function be executed. If execution of ``Init`` is requested, fabric will ensure
that ``Init`` is invoked before any other function and is only invoked once.
This option provides you additional control over which users can initialize the
chaincode and the ability to add initial data to the ledger. If you are using
the peer CLI to approve the chaincode definition, use the ``--init-required``
flag to request the execution of the ``Init`` function. Then call the ``Init``
function by using the `peer chaincode invoke` command and passing the
``--isInit`` flag. If you are using the Fabric SDK for Node.js, visit
`How to install and start your chaincode <https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/master/tutorial-chaincode-lifecycle.html>`__. For more information, see :doc:`chaincode4noah`.

The other interface in the chaincode "shim" APIs is the ``ChaincodeStubInterface``:

  - `Go <https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim#ChaincodeStubInterface>`__
  - `node.js <https://fabric-shim.github.io/ChaincodeStub.html>`__
  - `Java <https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-chaincode-java/master/api/org/hyperledger/fabric/shim/ChaincodeStub.html>`_

which is used to access and modify the ledger, and to make invocations between
chaincodes.

In this tutorial using Go chaincode, we will demonstrate the use of these APIs
by implementing a simple chaincode application that manages simple "assets".

.. _Simple Asset Chaincode:

Simple Asset Chaincode
----------------------
Our application is a basic sample chaincode to create assets
(key-value pairs) on the ledger.

Choosing a Location for the Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you haven't been doing programming in Go, you may want to make sure that
you have :ref:`Golang` installed and your system properly configured.

Now, you will want to create a directory for your chaincode application as a
child directory of ``$GOPATH/src/``.

To keep things simple, let's use the following command:

.. code:: bash

  mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/sacc && cd $GOPATH/src/sacc

Now, let's create the source file that we'll fill in with code:

.. code:: bash

  touch sacc.go

Housekeeping
^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, let's start with some housekeeping. As with every chaincode, it implements the
`Chaincode interface <https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim#Chaincode>`_
in particular, ``Init`` and ``Invoke`` functions. So, let's add the Go import
statements for the necessary dependencies for our chaincode. We'll import the
chaincode shim package and the
`peer protobuf package <https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-protos-go/peer>`_.
Next, let's add a struct ``SimpleAsset`` as a receiver for Chaincode shim functions.

.. code:: go

    package main

    import (
    	"fmt"

    	"github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim"
    	"github.com/hyperledger/fabric-protos-go/peer"
    )

    // SimpleAsset implements a simple chaincode to manage an asset
    type SimpleAsset struct {
    }

Initializing the Chaincode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, we'll implement the ``Init`` function.

.. code:: go

  // Init is called during chaincode instantiation to initialize any data.
  func (t *SimpleAsset) Init(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response {

  }

.. note:: Note that chaincode upgrade also calls this function. When writing a
          chaincode that will upgrade an existing one, make sure to modify the ``Init``
          function appropriately. In particular, provide an empty "Init" method if there's
          no "migration" or nothing to be initialized as part of the upgrade.

Next, we'll retrieve the arguments to the ``Init`` call using the
`ChaincodeStubInterface.GetStringArgs <https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim#ChaincodeStub.GetStringArgs>`_
function and check for validity. In our case, we are expecting a key-value pair.

  .. code:: go

    // Init is called during chaincode instantiation to initialize any
    // data. Note that chaincode upgrade also calls this function to reset
    // or to migrate data, so be careful to avoid a scenario where you
    // inadvertently clobber your ledger's data!
    func (t *SimpleAsset) Init(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response {
      // Get the args from the transaction proposal
      args := stub.GetStringArgs()
      if len(args) != 2 {
        return shim.Error("Incorrect arguments. Expecting a key and a value")
      }
    }

Next, now that we have established that the call is valid, we'll store the
initial state in the ledger. To do this, we will call
`ChaincodeStubInterface.PutState <https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim#ChaincodeStub.PutState>`_
with the key and value passed in as the arguments. Assuming all went well,
return a peer.Response object that indicates the initialization was a success.

.. code:: go

  // Init is called during chaincode instantiation to initialize any
  // data. Note that chaincode upgrade also calls this function to reset
  // or to migrate data, so be careful to avoid a scenario where you
  // inadvertently clobber your ledger's data!
  func (t *SimpleAsset) Init(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response {
    // Get the args from the transaction proposal
    args := stub.GetStringArgs()
    if len(args) != 2 {
      return shim.Error("Incorrect arguments. Expecting a key and a value")
    }

    // Set up any variables or assets here by calling stub.PutState()

    // We store the key and the value on the ledger
    err := stub.PutState(args[0], []byte(args[1]))
    if err != nil {
      return shim.Error(fmt.Sprintf("Failed to create asset: %s", args[0]))
    }
    return shim.Success(nil)
  }

Invoking the Chaincode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, let's add the ``Invoke`` function's signature.

.. code:: go

    // Invoke is called per transaction on the chaincode. Each transaction is
    // either a 'get' or a 'set' on the asset created by Init function. The 'set'
    // method may create a new asset by specifying a new key-value pair.
    func (t *SimpleAsset) Invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response {

    }

As with the ``Init`` function above, we need to extract the arguments from the
``ChaincodeStubInterface``. The ``Invoke`` function's arguments will be the
name of the chaincode application function to invoke. In our case, our application
will simply have two functions: ``set`` and ``get``, that allow the value of an
asset to be set or its current state to be retrieved. We first call
`ChaincodeStubInterface.GetFunctionAndParameters <https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim#ChaincodeStub.GetFunctionAndParameters>`_
to extract the function name and the parameters to that chaincode application
function.

.. code:: go

    // Invoke is called per transaction on the chaincode. Each transaction is
    // either a 'get' or a 'set' on the asset created by Init function. The Set
    // method may create a new asset by specifying a new key-value pair.
    func (t *SimpleAsset) Invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response {
    	// Extract the function and args from the transaction proposal
    	fn, args := stub.GetFunctionAndParameters()

    }

Next, we'll validate the function name as being either ``set`` or ``get``, and
invoke those chaincode application functions, returning an appropriate
response via the ``shim.Success`` or ``shim.Error`` functions that will
serialize the response into a gRPC protobuf message.

.. code:: go

    // Invoke is called per transaction on the chaincode. Each transaction is
    // either a 'get' or a 'set' on the asset created by Init function. The Set
    // method may create a new asset by specifying a new key-value pair.
    func (t *SimpleAsset) Invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response {
    	// Extract the function and args from the transaction proposal
    	fn, args := stub.GetFunctionAndParameters()

    	var result string
    	var err error
    	if fn == "set" {
    		result, err = set(stub, args)
    	} else {
    		result, err = get(stub, args)
    	}
    	if err != nil {
    		return shim.Error(err.Error())
    	}

    	// Return the result as success payload
    	return shim.Success([]byte(result))
    }

Implementing the Chaincode Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As noted, our chaincode application implements two functions that can be
invoked via the ``Invoke`` function. Let's implement those functions now.
Note that as we mentioned above, to access the ledger's state, we will leverage
the `ChaincodeStubInterface.PutState <https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim#ChaincodeStub.PutState>`_
and `ChaincodeStubInterface.GetState <https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim#ChaincodeStub.GetState>`_
functions of the chaincode shim API.

.. code:: go

    // Set stores the asset (both key and value) on the ledger. If the key exists,
    // it will override the value with the new one
    func set(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) (string, error) {
    	if len(args) != 2 {
    		return "", fmt.Errorf("Incorrect arguments. Expecting a key and a value")
    	}

    	err := stub.PutState(args[0], []byte(args[1]))
    	if err != nil {
    		return "", fmt.Errorf("Failed to set asset: %s", args[0])
    	}
    	return args[1], nil
    }

    // Get returns the value of the specified asset key
    func get(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) (string, error) {
    	if len(args) != 1 {
    		return "", fmt.Errorf("Incorrect arguments. Expecting a key")
    	}

    	value, err := stub.GetState(args[0])
    	if err != nil {
    		return "", fmt.Errorf("Failed to get asset: %s with error: %s", args[0], err)
    	}
    	if value == nil {
    		return "", fmt.Errorf("Asset not found: %s", args[0])
    	}
    	return string(value), nil
    }

.. _Chaincode Sample:

Pulling it All Together
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, we need to add the ``main`` function, which will call the
`shim.Start <https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim#Start>`_
function. Here's the whole chaincode program source.

.. code:: go

    package main

    import (
    	"fmt"

    	"github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim"
    	"github.com/hyperledger/fabric-protos-go/peer"
    )

    // SimpleAsset implements a simple chaincode to manage an asset
    type SimpleAsset struct {
    }

    // Init is called during chaincode instantiation to initialize any
    // data. Note that chaincode upgrade also calls this function to reset
    // or to migrate data.
    func (t *SimpleAsset) Init(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response {
    	// Get the args from the transaction proposal
    	args := stub.GetStringArgs()
    	if len(args) != 2 {
    		return shim.Error("Incorrect arguments. Expecting a key and a value")
    	}

    	// Set up any variables or assets here by calling stub.PutState()

    	// We store the key and the value on the ledger
    	err := stub.PutState(args[0], []byte(args[1]))
    	if err != nil {
    		return shim.Error(fmt.Sprintf("Failed to create asset: %s", args[0]))
    	}
    	return shim.Success(nil)
    }

    // Invoke is called per transaction on the chaincode. Each transaction is
    // either a 'get' or a 'set' on the asset created by Init function. The Set
    // method may create a new asset by specifying a new key-value pair.
    func (t *SimpleAsset) Invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response {
    	// Extract the function and args from the transaction proposal
    	fn, args := stub.GetFunctionAndParameters()

    	var result string
    	var err error
    	if fn == "set" {
    		result, err = set(stub, args)
    	} else { // assume 'get' even if fn is nil
    		result, err = get(stub, args)
    	}
    	if err != nil {
    		return shim.Error(err.Error())
    	}

    	// Return the result as success payload
    	return shim.Success([]byte(result))
    }

    // Set stores the asset (both key and value) on the ledger. If the key exists,
    // it will override the value with the new one
    func set(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) (string, error) {
    	if len(args) != 2 {
    		return "", fmt.Errorf("Incorrect arguments. Expecting a key and a value")
    	}

    	err := stub.PutState(args[0], []byte(args[1]))
    	if err != nil {
    		return "", fmt.Errorf("Failed to set asset: %s", args[0])
    	}
    	return args[1], nil
    }

    // Get returns the value of the specified asset key
    func get(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) (string, error) {
    	if len(args) != 1 {
    		return "", fmt.Errorf("Incorrect arguments. Expecting a key")
    	}

    	value, err := stub.GetState(args[0])
    	if err != nil {
    		return "", fmt.Errorf("Failed to get asset: %s with error: %s", args[0], err)
    	}
    	if value == nil {
    		return "", fmt.Errorf("Asset not found: %s", args[0])
    	}
    	return string(value), nil
    }

    // main function starts up the chaincode in the container during instantiate
    func main() {
    	if err := shim.Start(new(SimpleAsset)); err != nil {
    		fmt.Printf("Error starting SimpleAsset chaincode: %s", err)
    	}
    }

Building Chaincode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's compile your chaincode.

.. code:: bash

  go get -u github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go
  go build

Assuming there are no errors, now we can proceed to the next step, testing
your chaincode.

Testing Using dev mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Normally chaincodes are started and maintained by peer. However in “dev
mode", chaincode is built and started by the user. This mode is useful
during chaincode development phase for rapid code/build/run/debug cycle
turnaround.

We start "dev mode" by leveraging pre-generated orderer and channel artifacts for
a sample dev network.  As such, the user can immediately jump into the process
of compiling chaincode and driving calls.

Install Hyperledger Fabric Samples
----------------------------------

If you haven't already done so, please :doc:`install`.

Navigate to the ``chaincode-docker-devmode`` directory of the ``fabric-samples``
clone:

.. code:: bash

  cd chaincode-docker-devmode

Now open three terminals and navigate to your ``chaincode-docker-devmode``
directory in each.

Terminal 1 - Start the network
------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-simple.yaml up

The above starts the network with the ``SingleSampleMSPSolo`` orderer profile and
launches the peer in "dev mode".  It also launches two additional containers -
one for the chaincode environment and a CLI to interact with the chaincode.  The
commands for create and join channel are embedded in the CLI container, so we
can jump immediately to the chaincode calls.

- Note: the peer is not using TLS because the dev mode does not work with TLS.

Terminal 2 - Build & start the chaincode
----------------------------------------

.. code:: bash

  docker exec -it chaincode sh

You should see the following:

.. code:: sh

  /opt/gopath/src/chaincode $

Now, compile your chaincode:

.. code:: sh

  cd sacc
  go build

Now run the chaincode:

.. code:: sh

  CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME=mycc:0 CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=false ./sacc -peer.address peer:7052

The chaincode is started with peer and chaincode logs indicating successful registration with the peer.
Note that at this stage the chaincode is not associated with any channel. This is done in subsequent steps
using the ``instantiate`` command.

Terminal 3 - Use the chaincode
------------------------------

Even though you are in ``--peer-chaincodedev`` mode, you still have to install the
chaincode so the life-cycle system chaincode can go through its checks normally.
This requirement may be removed in future when in ``--peer-chaincodedev`` mode.

We'll leverage the CLI container to drive these calls.

.. code:: bash

  docker exec -it cli bash

.. code:: bash

  peer chaincode install -p chaincodedev/chaincode/sacc -n mycc -v 0
  peer chaincode instantiate -n mycc -v 0 -c '{"Args":["a","10"]}' -C myc

Now issue an invoke to change the value of "a" to "20".

.. code:: bash

  peer chaincode invoke -n mycc -c '{"Args":["set", "a", "20"]}' -C myc

Finally, query ``a``.  We should see a value of ``20``.

.. code:: bash

  peer chaincode query -n mycc -c '{"Args":["query","a"]}' -C myc

Testing new chaincode
---------------------

By default, we mount only ``sacc``.  However, you can easily test different
chaincodes by adding them to the ``chaincode`` subdirectory and relaunching
your network.  At this point they will be accessible in your ``chaincode`` container.

Chaincode access control
------------------------

Chaincode can utilize the client (submitter) certificate for access
control decisions by calling the GetCreator() function. Additionally
the Go shim provides extension APIs that extract client identity
from the submitter's certificate that can be used for access control decisions,
whether that is based on client identity itself, or the org identity,
or on a client identity attribute.

For example an asset that is represented as a key/value may include the
client's identity as part of the value (for example as a JSON attribute
indicating that asset owner), and only this client may be authorized
to make updates to the key/value in the future. The client identity
library extension APIs can be used within chaincode to retrieve this
submitter information to make such access control decisions.

See the `client identity (CID) library documentation <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/blob/master/pkg/cid/README.md>`_
for more details.

To add the client identity shim extension to your chaincode as a dependency, see :ref:`vendoring`.

.. _vendoring:

Managing external dependencies for chaincode written in Go
----------------------------------------------------------
Your Go chaincode requires packages (like the chaincode shim) that are not part
of the Go standard library. These packages must be included in your chaincode
package.

There are `many tools available <https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/PackageManagementTools>`__
for managing (or "vendoring") these dependencies.  The following demonstrates how to use
``govendor``:

.. code:: bash

  govendor init
  govendor add +external  // Add all external package, or
  govendor add github.com/external/pkg // Add specific external package

This imports the external dependencies into a local ``vendor`` directory.
If you are vendoring the Fabric shim or shim extensions, clone the
Fabric repository to your $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger directory,
before executing the govendor commands.

Once dependencies are vendored in your chaincode directory, ``peer chaincode package``
and ``peer chaincode install`` operations will then include code associated with the
dependencies into the chaincode package.
