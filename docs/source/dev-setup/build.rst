Building Hyperledger Fabric
---------------------------

The following instructions assume that you have already set up your
:doc:`development environment <devenv>`.

To build Hyperledger Fabric:

::

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric
    make dist-clean all

Running the unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before running the unit tests, a PKCS #11 cryptographic token implementation
must be installed and configured. The PKCS #11 API is used by the bccsp
component of Fabric to interact with devices, such as hardware security modules
(HSMs), that store cryptographic information and perform cryptographic
computations. For test environments, SoftHSM can be used to satisfy this
requirement.

SoftHSM can be installed with the following commands:

::

    sudo apt install libsofthsm2 # Ubuntu
    sudo yum install softhsm     # CentOS
    brew install softhsm         # macOS

Once SoftHSM is installed, additional configuration may be required. For
example, the default configuration file stores token data in a system directory
that unprivileged users are unable to write to.

Configuration typically involves copying ``/etc/softhsm2.conf`` to
``$HOME/.config/softhsm2/softhsm2.conf`` and changing ``directories.tokendir``
to an appropriate location. Please see the man page for ``softhsm2.conf`` for
details.

After SoftHSM has been configured, the following command can be used to
initialize the required token:

::

    softhsm2-util --init-token --slot 0 --label "ForFabric" --so-pin 1234 --pin 98765432

If the test cannot find libsofthsm2.so in your environment, specify its path,
the PIN and the label of the token through environment variables. For example,
on macOS:

::

    export PKCS11_LIB="/usr/local/Cellar/softhsm/2.5.0/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so"
    export PKCS11_PIN=98765432
    export PKCS11_LABEL="ForFabric"

Use the following sequence to run all unit tests:

::

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric
    make unit-test

To run a subset of tests, set the TEST_PKGS environment variable.
Specify a list of packages (separated by space), for example:

::

    export TEST_PKGS="github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/ledger/..."
    make unit-test

To run a specific test use the ``-run RE`` flag where RE is a regular
expression that matches the test case name. To run tests with verbose
output use the ``-v`` flag. For example, to run the ``TestGetFoo`` test
case, change to the directory containing the ``foo_test.go`` and
call/execute

::

    go test -v -run=TestGetFoo


Running Node.js Client SDK Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must also run the Node.js unit tests to ensure that the Node.js
client SDK is not broken by your changes. To run the Node.js unit tests,
follow the instructions
`here <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/README.md>`__.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration utilizes the `viper <https://github.com/spf13/viper>`__
and `cobra <https://github.com/spf13/cobra>`__ libraries.

There is a **core.yaml** file that contains the configuration for the
peer process. Many of the configuration settings can be overridden on
the command line by setting ENV variables that match the configuration
setting, but by prefixing with *'CORE\_'*. For example, setting
`peer.networkId` can be accomplished with:

::

    CORE_PEER_NETWORKID=custom-network-id peer
